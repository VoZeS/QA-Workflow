# QA Workflow
## Quality Assurance (QA)
QA is a systematic and planned process implemented to provide confidence on the developed product and fulfill its quality demands for the customers. This cannot be mixed up with Quality Control, which objective is to determine which are the quality requirements for the QA to fulfill. And last, there is Testing, process that detects the errors in the product.

## QA in Video Games
Quality Assurance in videogames is by far one of the most important process in _Video Game Development_. The QA Process is the one that prevents all videogames to be plenty of _bugs_ and _glitches_ breaking the game. So, for that, just like Programming needs programmers and Art needs artists, Quality Assurance needs also a team.

### QA Team
QA Team may be the most undervalued team in game development, yet the most important, so they are responsible of finding all errors that break the game experience. To do so, there are different charges and responsibilites inside their team:

* **QA Tester:** Testers need to know what are they doing. Seriously, they have to know what kind of videogame are they playing, what is its purpose, which are its requirements and how is supposed to be the videogame to know when something related to gameplay, prograssion, tech or graphics do not fit in the game like it should, so they can report it. But, how do they do that? By playing and replaying the videogame, chapter, level, or even screen over and over. It is not as fun as it sounds. Remember they do not have to play for fun, they have to play for finding the maximum errors as possible. Once they have found a issue, they have to create a proper documentation of the error to communicate it to programmers, artists or whoever that error concerns. Then, they have to test the fixed issues to ensure it has been fixed.

* **Senior QA:** These are just experienced game testers. For that, they are often responsible for testing bigger parts of the game or the most important ones. They might mentor Junior QA Testers.

* **QA Lead:** To become a QA Lead, you have to be an experienced tester. Leads manage their tester's team, organize work schedules and playtesting sessions and, usually, can be considered as mentors for their team members testers.

* **QA Director:** Having started as testers, directors do no test anymore. This role exist when the company is big enough to have multiple projects simultaneously or when providing outsourced QA Services. Their job is to manage and supervise all QA Teams existing at that moment. 

* **QA Automation Tester & QA Test Engineer:** These roles are more dependable in QA. The first one is responsible to automate the testing process to save maximum time as possible. He/She needs to have certain level of programming, so they might have to create a script for specific repeatable actions. The second role's job is to program improvements for needed tools and processes to test the game. These oversees the project from a production Point of View.
